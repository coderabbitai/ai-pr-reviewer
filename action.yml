      GitHub pull request has the title - 
      `$title` 

      Here is the description -
      ```
      $description
      ```

      Here is the diff for `$filename` -
      ```diff
      $file_diff
      ```

      I would like you to summarize the diff within 50 words.
  summarize:

      Here is the summary of changes you have generated for each file -
      ```
      $summary
      ```

      Provide your final response in the `markdown` format with 
      the following content -
        - Thank the user for letting you participate in the code review. 
        - High-level summary (comment on the overall change instead of 
          specific files within 80 words)
        - Table of files and their summaries. You can group files with 
          similar changes together into one row to save space.

      Avoid additional commentary as this summary will be added as a 
      comment on the GitHub pull request.

      stage'

      Create concise release notes in `markdown` format for this pull request, 
      focusing on its purpose and user story. You can classify the changes as 
      "New Feature", "Bug fix", "Documentation", "Refactor", "Style", 
      "Test", "Chore", "Revert", and provide a bullet point list. For example: 
      "New Feature: An integrations page was added to the UI". Keep your 
      response within 50-100 words. Avoid additional commentary as this response 
      will be used as is in our release notes.

      Below the release notes, generate a short, celebratory poem about the 
      changes in this PR and add this poem as a quote (> symbol). You can 
      use emojis in the poem, where they are relevant.
  review_file_diff:
    required: false
    description: 'The prompt for each file'
    default: |
      GitHub pull request has the title - 
      `$title` 

      Here is the description -
      ```
      $description
      ```

      Here is the OpenAI generated summary -
      ```
      $summary
      ```

      Here is the content of file `$filename` -
      ```
      $file_content
      ```

      Format for changes and review comments (if any) 
      on line ranges -
      <start_line-end_line>: 
      ```diff
      <diff_hunk>
      ```
      ```text
      <existing review comments>
      ```
      ---
      <start_line-end_line>: 
      ```diff
      <diff_hunk>
      ```
      ---
      ...

      The <diff_hunk> is in the unidiff format which 
      represent the differences between two text files, 
      displaying added, removed, and unchanged lines with 
      "+" or "-" prefixes and surrounding context lines. 

      Changes for review -
      $patches

      Your review must consist of comments in the below format 
      with a separator between review comments Any other 
      commentary outside of this format will be ignored and will not 
      be read by the parser -
      <start_line-end_line>:
      <review>
      ---
      <replace_start_line-replace_end_line>:
      <review>
      ```suggestion
      <new code from replace_start_line to replace_end_line>
      ```
      ---
      ...

      Make sure your comments are not outside the line ranges in the changes,
      though you can comment on sub-line ranges. If you want to suggest code 
      changes, the replacement code you suggest must not be in the diff format 
      and must be exact code that will replace existing code between 
      <replace_start_line> and <replace_end_line> based in line number in the 
      new file.

      Reflect on the provided code at least 3 times to identify any 
      bug risks or provide improvement suggestions in these diff hunks. 
      You will point out potential issues such as security, logic errors, 
      syntax errors, out of bound errors, data races, consistency, 
      complexity, error handling, typos, grammar, maintainability, 
      performance, and so on. 

      If there are no issues or suggestions and the diff hunk is acceptable 
      as-is, please include "LGTM!" (exact word) in your short 
      review comment.

      Your responses will be recorded as multi-line review comments on the 
      GitHub pull request. Markdown format is preferred for your responses.
