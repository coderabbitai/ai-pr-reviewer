# OpenAI ChatGPT-based PR reviewer and summarizer

![AI](./docs/images/ai.png)

## Overview

This [OpenAI ChatGPT-based](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) GitHub
Action provides a summary, release notes and review of pull requests. The unique
features of this action are:

- **Line-by-line code change suggestions**: This action reviews the changes line
  by line and provides code change suggestions that can be directly committed
  from the GitHub UI.
- **Continuous, incremental reviews**: Reviews are performed on each commit
  within a pull request, rather than a one-time review on the entire pull
  request.
- **Cost-effective and reduced noise**: Incremental reviews save on OpenAI costs
  and reduce noise by tracking changed files between commits and the base of the
  pull request.
- **"Light" model for summary**: Designed to be used with a "light"
  summarization model (e.g. `gpt-3.5-turbo`) and a "heavy" review model (e.g.
  `gpt-4`). _For best results, use `gpt-4` as the "heavy" model, as thorough
  code review needs strong reasoning abilities._
- **Chat with bot**: Supports conversation with the bot in the context of lines
  of code or entire files, useful for providing context, generating test cases,
  and reducing code complexity.
- **Smart review skipping**: By default, skips in-depth review for simple
  changes (e.g. typo fixes) and when changes look good for the most part. It can
  be disabled by setting `review_simple_changes` and `review_comment_lgtm` to
  `true`.
- **Customizable prompts**: Tailor the `system_message`, `summarize`, and
  `summarize_release_notes` prompts to focus on specific aspects of the review
  process or even change the review objective.

# Professional Version of CodeRabbit <br/>

The professional version of our openai-pr-reviewer project is now live at
[coderabbit.ai](http://Coderabbit.ai). Building upon our open-source foundation,
CodeRabbit offers improved features, dedicated support, and our ongoing
commitment to superior code reviews.

## Usage

Add the below file to your repository at
`.github/workflows/openai-pr-reviewer.yml`

```yaml
name: Code Review

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request:
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group:
    ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.number || github.head_ref ||
    github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name ==
    'pull_request_review_comment' && 'pr_comment' || 'pr' }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request_review_comment' }}

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: coderabbitai/openai-pr-reviewer@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
        with:
          debug: false
          review_simple_changes: false
          review_comment_lgtm: false
```

### Conversation with OpenAI

You can reply to a review comment made by this action and get a response based
on the diff context. Additionally, you can invite the bot to a conversation by
tagging it in the comment (`@openai`).

Example:

> @openai Please generate a test plan for this file.

Note: A review comment is a comment made on a diff or a file in the pull
request.

### Ignoring PRs

Sometimes it is useful to ignore a PR. For example, if you are using this action
to review documentation, you can ignore PRs that only change the documentation.
To ignore a PR, add the following keyword in the PR description:

```text
@openai: ignore
```

#### Environment variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This should already be available to the GitHub Action
  environment. This is used to add comments to the pull request.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: use this to authenticate with OpenAI API. You can get one
  [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Please add this key to
  your GitHub Action secrets.
- `OPENAI_API_ORG`: (optional) use this to use the specified organization with
  OpenAI API if you have multiple. Please add this key to your GitHub Action
  secrets.

### Models: `gpt-4` and `gpt-3.5-turbo`

At FluxNinja, we use `gpt-3.5-turbo` for lighter tasks such as summarizing the
changes (`openai_light_model` in configuration) and `gpt-4` for more complex
review and commenting tasks (`openai_heavy_model` in configuration).

Costs: `gpt-3.5-turbo` is dirt cheap. `gpt-4` is orders of magnitude more
expensive, but the results are vastly superior. We are typically spending $20 a
day for a 20 developer team with `gpt-4` based review and commenting.

### Prompts & Configuration

See: [action.yml](./action.yml)

Tip: You can change the bot personality by configuring the `system_message`
value. For example, to review docs/blog posts, you can use the following prompt:

<details>
<summary>Blog Reviewer Prompt</summary>

```yaml
system_message: |
  You are `@openai` (aka `github-actions[bot]`), a language model
  trained by OpenAI. Your purpose is to act as a highly experienced
  DevRel (developer relations) professional with focus on cloud-native
  infrastructure.

  Company context -
  FluxNinja is a cloud-native intelligent load management platform.
  The platform is powered by Aperture, an open-source project, which
  provides a control systems inspired policy language for defining
  observability driven control loop. FluxNinja's load management,
  such as prioritized load shedding and load-based autoscaling,
  ensures system stability. FluxNinja ARC, the commercial solution,
  offers advanced analytics, intelligent alerting, and policy
  visualization.

  When reviewing or generating content focus on key areas such as -
  - Accuracy
  - Relevance
  - Clarity
  - Technical depth
  - Call-to-action
  - SEO optimization
  - Brand consistency
  - Grammar and prose
  - Typos
  - Hyperlink suggestions
  - Graphics or images (suggest Dall-E image prompts if needed)
  - Empathy
  - Engagement
```

</details>

Any suggestions or pull requests for improving the prompts are highly
appreciated.

## Developing

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy, tested
> with node 16.

Install the dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution

```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

## FAQs

### Review pull requests from forks

GitHub Actions limits the access of secrets from forked repositories. To enable
this feature, you need to use the `pull_request_target` event instead of
`pull_request` in your workflow file. Note that with `pull_request_target`, you
need extra configuration to ensure checking out the right commit:

```yaml
name: Code Review

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group:
    ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.number || github.head_ref ||
    github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name ==
    'pull_request_review_comment' && 'pr_comment' || 'pr' }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request_review_comment' }}

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: coderabbitai/openai-pr-reviewer@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
        with:
          debug: false
          review_simple_changes: false
          review_comment_lgtm: false
```

### Inspect the messages between OpenAI server

Set `debug: true` in the workflow file to enable debug mode, which will show the
messages

### Disclaimer

- Your code (files, diff, PR title/description) will be sent to OpenAI's servers
  for processing. Please check with your compliance team before using this on
  your private code repositories.
- OpenAI's API is used instead of ChatGPT session on their portal. OpenAI API
  has a
  [more conservative data usage policy](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies)
  compared to their ChatGPT offering.
- This action is not affiliated with OpenAI.
