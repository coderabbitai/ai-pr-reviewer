# OpenAI ChatGPT-based PR reviewer and summarizer

![AI](./docs/images/ai.png)

## Overview

This [OpenAI ChatGPT-based](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) GitHub
Action provides a summary, release notes and review of pull requests. The
prompts have been tuned for a concise response. To prevent excessive
notifications, this action can be configured to skip adding review comments when
the changes look good for the most part.

In addition, this action can also reply to the user comments made on the review
by this action.

NOTES:

- Your code (files, diff, PR title/description) will be sent to OpenAI's servers
  for processing. Please check with your compliance team before using this on
  your private code repositories.
- OpenAI's API is used instead of ChatGPT session on their portal. OpenAI API
  has a
  [more conservative data usage policy](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies)
  compared to their ChatGPT offering.
- This action is not affiliated with OpenAI.
- This action is going through rapid iteration, so expect breaking changes.

## Usage

Add the below file to your repository at
`.github/workflows/openai-pr-reviewer.yml`

```yaml
name: Code Review

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request:
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group:
    ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.number || github.head_ref ||
    github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name ==
    'pull_request_review_comment' && 'pr_comment' || 'pr' }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request_review_comment' }}

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: fluxninja/openai-pr-reviewer@latest
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
        with:
          debug: false
          review_comment_lgtm: false
```

### Conversation with OpenAI

You can reply to a review comment made by this action and get a response based
on the diff context. Additionally, you can invite the bot to a conversation by
tagging it in the comment (`@openai`).

Example:

> @openai Please generate a test plan for this file.

Note: A review comment is a comment made on a diff or a file in the pull
request.

### Ignoring PRs

Sometimes it is useful to ignore a PR. For example, if you are using this action
to review documentation, you can ignore PRs that only change the documentation.
To ignore a PR, add the following keyword in the PR description:

```text
@openai: ignore
```

#### Environment variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This should already be available to the GitHub Action
  environment. This is used to add comments to the pull request.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: use this to authenticate with OpenAI API. You can get one
  [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Please add this key to
  your GitHub Action secrets.
- `OPENAI_API_ORG`: (optional) use this to use the specified organisation with OpenAI API if you have multiple. Please add this key to your GitHub Action secrets.

### Models: `gpt-4` and `gpt-3.5-turbo`

At FluxNinja, we use `gpt-3.5-turbo` for lighter tasks such as summarizing the
changes (`openai_light_model` in configuration) and `gpt-4` for more complex
review and commenting tasks (`openai_heavy_model` in configuration).

Costs: `gpt-3.5-turbo` is dirt cheap. `gpt-4` is orders of magnitude more
expensive, but the results are vastly superior. We are typically spending $50 a
day for a 20 developer team with `gpt-4` based review and commenting.

### Prompts & Configuration

See: [action.yml](./action.yml)

Tip: You can change the bot personality by configuring the `system_message`
value. For example, to review docs/blog posts, you can use the following prompt:

<details>
<summary>Blog Reviewer Prompt</summary>

```yaml
system_message: |
  You are `@openai` (aka `github-actions[bot]`), a language model
  trained by OpenAI. Your purpose is to act as a highly experienced
  DevRel (developer relations) professional with focus on cloud-native
  infrastructure.

  Company context -
  FluxNinja is a cloud-native intelligent load management platform.
  The platform is powered by Aperture, an open-source project, which
  provides a control systems inspired policy language for defining
  observability driven control loop. FluxNinja's load management,
  such as prioritized load shedding and load-based autoscaling,
  ensures system stability. FluxNinja ARC, the commercial solution,
  offers advanced analytics, intelligent alerting, and policy
  visualization.

  When reviewing or generating content focus on key areas such as -
  - Accuracy
  - Relevance
  - Clarity
  - Technical depth
  - Call-to-action
  - SEO optimization
  - Brand consistency
  - Grammar and prose
  - Typos
  - Hyperlink suggestions
  - Graphics or images (suggest Dall-E image prompts if needed)
  - Empathy
  - Engagement
```

</details>

Any suggestions or pull requests for improving the prompts are highly
appreciated.

## Developing

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy, tested
> with node 16.

Install the dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution

```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

## FAQs

### Review pull requests from forks

GitHub Actions limits the access of secrets from forked repositories. To enable
this feature, you need to use the `pull_request_target` event instead of
`pull_request` in your workflow file. Note that with `pull_request_target`, you
need extra configuration to ensure checking out the right commit:

```yaml
name: Code Review

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group:
    ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.number || github.head_ref ||
    github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name ==
    'pull_request_review_comment' && 'pr_comment' || 'pr' }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request_review_comment' }}

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: fluxninja/openai-pr-reviewer@latest
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
        with:
          debug: false
          review_comment_lgtm: false
```
