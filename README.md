# OpenAI ChatGPT based PR reviewer and summarizer

![AI](./docs/images/ai.png)

## Overview

This [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat) based GitHub
Action provides a summary, release notes and review of pull requests. The
prompts have been tuned for a concise response. To prevent excessive
notifications, this action can be configured to skip adding review comments when
the changes look good for the most part.

In addition, this action can also reply to the user comments made on the review
by this action.

NOTES:

- Your code (files, diff, PR title/description) will be sent to OpenAI's servers
  for processing. Please check with your compliance team before using this on
  your private code repositories.
- OpenAI's API is used instead of ChatGPT session on their portal. OpenAI API
  has a
  [more conservative data usage policy](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies)
  compared to their ChatGPT offering.

## Usage

Add the below file to your repository at
`.github/workflows/openai-pr-reviewer.yml`

```yaml

  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request:
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group:
    ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.number || github.head_ref ||
    github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name ==
    'pull_request_review_comment' && 'pr_comment' || 'pr' }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request_review_comment' }}

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: fluxninja/openai-pr-reviewer@latest
        env:

tagging it in the comment (`@openai`).

#### Environment variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: This should already be available to the GitHub Action
  environment. This is used to add comments to the pull request.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: use this to authenticate with OpenAI API. You can get one
  [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Please add this key to
  your GitHub Action secrets.

### Prompts & Configuration

See: [action.yml](./action.yml)

Any suggestions or pull requests for improving the prompts are highly
appreciated.

## Developing

> First, you'll need to have a reasonably modern version of `node` handy, tested
> with node 16.

Install the dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript and package it for distribution

```bash
$ npm run build && npm run package
```

## FAQs

### Review pull request from forks

GitHub Actions limits the access of secrets from forked repositories. To enable
this feature, you need to use the `pull_request_target` event instead of
`pull_request` in your workflow file. Note that with `pull_request_target`, you
need extra configuration to ensure checking out the right commit:

```yaml
name: Code Review

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

concurrency:
  group:
    ${{ github.repository }}-${{ github.event.number || github.head_ref ||
    github.sha }}-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name ==
    'pull_request_review_comment' && 'pr_comment' || 'pr' }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request_review_comment' }}

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: fluxninja/openai-pr-reviewer@latest
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
        with:
          debug: false
          review_comment_lgtm: false
```
