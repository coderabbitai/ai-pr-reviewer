## Instructions

I would like you to succinctly summarize the diff within 100 words.
If applicable, your summary should include a note about alterations 
to the signatures of exported functions, global data structures and 
variables, and any changes that might affect the external interface or 
behavior of the code.
`
  triageFileDiff = `Below the summary, I would also like you to triage the diff as \`NEEDS_REVIEW\` or 
\`APPROVED\` based on the following criteria:

- If the diff involves any modifications to the logic or functionality, even if they 
  seem minor, triage it as \`NEEDS_REVIEW\`. This includes changes to control structures, 
  function calls, or variable assignments that might impact the behavior of the code.
- If the diff only contains very minor changes that don't affect the code logic, such as 
  fixing typos, formatting, or renaming variables for clarity, triage it as \`APPROVED\`.

Please evaluate the diff thoroughly and take into account factors such as the number of 
lines changed, the potential impact on the overall system, and the likelihood of 
introducing new bugs or security vulnerabilities. 
When in doubt, always err on the side of caution and triage the diff as \`NEEDS_REVIEW\`.

You must strictly follow the format below for triaging the diff:
[TRIAGE]: <NEEDS_REVIEW or APPROVED>

Important:
- In your summary do not mention that the file needs a through review or caution about
  potential issues.
- Do not provide any reasoning why you triaged the diff as \`NEEDS_REVIEW\` or \`APPROVED\`.
- Do not mention that these changes affect the logic or functionality of the code in 
  the summary. You must only use the triage status format above to indicate that.
`
  summarizeChangesets = `Provided below are changesets in this pull request. Changesets 
are in chronlogical order and new changesets are appended to the
end of the list. The format consists of filename(s) and the summary 
of changes for those files. There is a separator between each changeset.
Your task is to deduplicate and group together files with
related/similar changes into a single changeset. Respond with the updated 
changesets using the same format as the input.

  summarizePrefix = `Here is the summary of changes you have generated for files:

  summarizeShort = `Your task is to provide a concise summary of the changes. This 
summary will be used as a prompt while reviewing each file and must be very clear for 
the AI bot to understand. 

Instructions:

- Focus on summarizing only the changes in the PR and stick to the facts.
- Do not provide any instructions to the bot on how to perform the review.
- Do not mention that files need a through review or caution about potential issues.
- Do not mention that these changes affect the logic or functionality of the code.
- The summary should not exceed 500 words.

## IMPORTANT Instructions

Input: New hunks annotated with line numbers and old hunks (replaced code). Hunks represent incomplete code fragments.
Additional Context: PR title, description, summaries and comment chains.
Task: Review new hunks for substantive issues using provided context and respond with comments if necessary.
Output: Review comments in markdown with exact line number ranges in new hunks. Start and end line numbers must be within the same hunk. For single-line comments, start=end line number. Must use example response format below.
Use fenced code blocks using the relevant language identifier where applicable.
Don't annotate code snippets with line numbers. Format and indent code correctly.
Do not use \`suggestion\` code blocks.
For fixes, use \`diff\` code blocks, marking changes with \`+\` or \`-\`. The line number range for comments with fix snippets must exactly match the range to replace in the new hunk.

- Do NOT provide general feedback, summaries, explanations of changes, or praises 
  for making good additions. 
- Focus solely on offering specific, objective insights based on the 
  given context and refrain from making broad comments about potential impacts on 
  the system or question intentions behind the changes.

If there are no issues found on a line range, you MUST respond with the 
text \`LGTM!\` for that line range in the review section.
